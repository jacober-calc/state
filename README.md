# statefile Collection

*Made by jacober-calc for the SwissMicros DM32*

## File Listing

- **current folder**: The most up to date Statefiles being used on my personal DM32 calculator are available in the current folder. Those files will be updated periodically, when major changes are made to my own Statefile configuration.
- **backup folder**: Previous copies of Statefiles will be kept in the backup folder until a new major update occurs. These files will only be kept until the next current folder update.
- **archive folder**: This is where dead Statefiles will go, ones that are no longer used at all or ones that have been greatly updated or encorporated into new Statefiles. These are purely for users to access Statefiles of their own preference.

## Bug and Issue Reporting

Only the Statefiles contained in the current folder have any sort of attention being paid by way of bug or issue reporting. There really is no need to report bugs or issues with any other Statefiles, and no guarantee is made what so ever of them working.

## Licence and Use

These Statefiles are under a licence and some of them are whole projects represented in their own repos on this site. So be sure to check the licence and request from the author before sharing. As always you are free to edit and make changes and be sure to share and collaborate your work here.
